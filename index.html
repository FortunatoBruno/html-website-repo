            <p>When it comes to hobbies, one thing I love to do is skate. Whenever I have free time I go skating, even if it is snowing or freezing. There is a good place to skate called Sens Rink of Dreams where I usually go. This is located in downtown Ottawa, near the Rideau Center Mall, 26 minutes from my home.</p>
            <p>As you can see from the photo, I really like cold weather and this is not a deterrent for me to stop doing what I like. And another thing that I also like to do in my free time is to leave the house, to go and visit new places, even if it is just a long walk in the neighborhood.</p>
